      Binary search is a highly efficient divide-and-conquer algorithm widely used for searching in sorted arrays.
      It works by repeatedly dividing the array in half and comparing the target element with the middle element.
      This process continues until the element is found or the search space is empty.
      Binary search is incredibly efficient, with a time complexity of O(log n) for a sorted array of n elements.
      It is often considered the go-to algorithm for searching in large datasets and is a fundamental concept in computer science.
